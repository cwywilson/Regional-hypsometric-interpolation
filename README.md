# Regional Glacier Mass Balance Gradient Analysis in SNP

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing decadal geodetic mass balance using binned elevation change data (`ddem_bin`) from regional Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) within Sirmilik National Park (SNP), Canadian Arctic.

## Overview

The notebook focuses on:

* Deriving mass balance gradients by binning regional DEM differences by elevation.
* Using elevation-area distribution (`hypsometry`) to interpret elevation-dependent mass changes.
* Providing insights into glacier response across elevation bands over multiple decades.

## Usage

1. Prepare your regional `ddem` raster file (e.g., from ArcticDEM or photogrammetry-derived DEMs).
2. Load your glacier shapefile (e.g., Glacier\_Inventory.shp).
3. Run the notebook: `Regional ddem_bin in SNP.ipynb`.
4. Analyze the elevation-binned mass balance output.
